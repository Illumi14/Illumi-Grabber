# Illumi-Grabber (educational purposes only)
This is a program i wrote that steals someone's chrome passwords and sends them to you via webhook

# how to use

download the grabber.exe file and run it
it should come up with a GUI and a cmd prompt
put your webhook in the box exactly as you copied it from discord with no spaces before or after
click build
if everything goes right you should be able to look in the cmd promt that opened and see it processing
you know its done when it says something like "created exe sucsessfully" in the cmd
then go into the dist folder that was created in the same directory as the grabber and the exe should be there
do not open it unless you want to grab your own info
now your done :D

for any help with errors contact Illu9907 on discord
